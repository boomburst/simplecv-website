We just returned from PyCon and we wanted to open-source all of the materials from [our tutorial](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/30/) so those who couldn't attend could still learn about SimpleCV. [All of the course materials are available at this github repository](https://github.com/sightmachine/simplecv-examples/tree/master/presentations). Posted below are the slides from the presentation as well as the video. If you want you can download the repository and follow along in the iPython notebook while watching the video and reading the slides.

We recently re-skinned the SimpleCV website and did some minor house keeping to the content and organization. Our goal was two fold, we wanted move to a more minimal design, and we also wanted to add some features that would allow us to show more user generated content. SimpleCV has now been in existence for over two years and we are starting to see an overwhelming number of really cool user projects. We wanted to create a place where we could share these projects with the greater community.  We also wanted a design that would allow us to quickly post notes about our development process and how we're using SimpleCV to solve real world problems. Plan to hear much more from us in the near future.

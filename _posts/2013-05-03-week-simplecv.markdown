It has been another fantastic week for SimpleCV! Today marks the deadline for Google Summer of Code proposal submissions. A number of promissing new students have submitted a bunch of great new features. These include:

- [A new smart rotate function](https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV/issues/236) that attempts to automatically straighten photos and images.
- Improvements to [the mean color computation](https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV/pull/506).
- A new image [normalization](https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV/pull/504) [method](https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV/pull/503).
- Numerous other bug fixes to the findLines method, color conversions, and the machine learning libraries.
- Special Relativity Demonstration


We also came across a number of really awesome user generated videos. Prof. Christian Mercat, a math professor in Lyon, France, created this incredible video that shows what a ruler would look like traveling at relativistic speeds to teach students about [special relativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).

**Motion Tracking with SimpleCV**

User Chris Papadopoulos created this short video of using SimpleCV's motion tracking routines to track objects and using the motion to control common computing tasks like opening a web browser.

**Multi-Camera Setup with SimpleCV**

Aayush Rana sent us a video that demonstrates multiple camera setups in SimpleCV. In this demo video Aayush performs color segmentation across the two cameras. The source code for this project can be [found here](https://github.com/aayushjr/outlinks-aj/blob/master/multiple.py).

description: > # SimpleCV is an open source framework for building computer vision
  applications. With it, you get access to several high-powered computer vision
  libraries such as OpenCV â€“ without having to first learn about bit depths, file
  formats, color spaces, buffer management, eigenvalues, or matrix versus bitmap
  storage. This is computer vision made easy.
